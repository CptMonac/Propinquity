* Think about and implement coop scoring. Both players should get points towards their total during coop. How should we handle score display at that time?
* The periods need to respect pausing
* Gravity didn't come back once
* Verify that particles are properly destroyed always
* Load/Unload songs as needed
* Multiple scoring patch handling?
* Max number of particles vs size
* Meta balls/Liquid 

* Handle actual behavior for vibe and patches
	* Player name mapping
	* Prox events

* Retry mechanism ...

* Testing ... ?

* Can HUD be cleaned up
* Can score be cleaned up

* Provide more robust behavior for variable quantity objects (Gloves, Patches, Xbees, Levels, etc)
* Provide meaning full null error messages throughout
