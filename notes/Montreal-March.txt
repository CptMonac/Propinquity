New XBee API:
=============
Prerequisites:
o Using new XBee API V0.9: http://code.google.com/p/xbee-api/
o Using Proclipsing environment in Eclipse

Local Discovery:
o Using proclipsing/DiscoverTest project
o Timeout problem:
  - 5-15% of the time: communication with a local XBee times out, either in XBee.open() or in waiting for a NI response
  - Reopening the port and retrying doesn't work: We read "garbage" data (partial packages, typical symptoms for either buffer overflow or an earlier partial package read)
  - Hot-plugging the USB ports in question (i.e. rebooting the XBees) and then reopening, works, even without restarting the DiscoverTest program: Decent workaround for now
