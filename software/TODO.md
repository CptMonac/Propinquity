TODO for Propinquity Software
=============================

* Gameplay
	* Think about and implement coop scoring. Both players should get points towards their total during coop. How should we handle score display at that time?
	* Multiple scoring patch handling?
	* Meta balls/Liquid/Coolness
	* Merge should work forever by summing particles size and getting bigger and bigger ....
	* Merge should be prox based
	* N player gravity

* Hardware control
	* Handle actual behavior for vibe and patches
	* Prox events
	* Add clear all command (diff from active)
	
* XBee stress test

* Logger with enablable println and warnings

* Code style/Nitpicks
	* Can HUD be cleaned up

	* Provide more robust behavior for variable quantity objects (Gloves, Patches, Xbees, Levels, etc)
	* Provide meaning full null error messages throughout 

	* if/switch/catch/for/while
	* Standard constructor arg ordering
