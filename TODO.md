XBees
-----------------------------
* XBee configuration should be saved and added to the git repo
* A new correct spreadsheet of the XBee addresses should be added to the repo

Hardware
-----------------------------
* Regulator footprint should have the EN polarity changed, this would be a more standard regulator package
* Header/footprint for an on/off switch is needed

Firmware
-----------------------------
* If would be nice if we could consider dumping the arduino IDE for makefiles
* A new state based version would be good for stability and reliability of communication, would require a concerted effort with software changes

Software
-----------------------------
* High level documentation should be produced
	* OO diagram
	* Protocol specifications
* See sofware/TODO.md
