-----------------------------
* XBee configuration should be saved and added to the git repo
* A new correct spreadsheet of the XBee addresses should be added to the repo

Hardware
-----------------------------
* List of version 2.0 recomendations should be made regarding the failures of the current version
* A version 1.1 could be produced to show possible corrections to version 1.0 if more were to be produced
* Could the red/prox issue be due to current draw issues

Firmware
-----------------------------
* If would be nice if we could consider dumping the arduino IDE for makefiles
* A new state based version would be good for stability and reliability of communication, would require a concerted effort with software changes

Software
-----------------------------
* High level documentation should be produced
	* OO diagram
	* Protocol specifications
* See sofware/TODO.md
