# Propinquity TODOs

## Documentation
* High level documentation
	* OO diagram
	* Protocol specifications

## XBees
* XBee configuration should be saved and added to the git repo
* A new correct record of the XBee addresses should be added to the repo

## Work Schedule

My high level plan for the first block of time (24h) looks like this.

 * Review the new hardware. (8-12h)
 	* Make any improvements I can to the current boards (such as changing regulator etc).
 * Review software from the hackathon (4-8h)
 	* Read new code (particularly from marius)
 	* Organize and document a bit so it's a least somewhat maintainable
 * Examine and address what bugs I can such as those in my notes and from Marius' notes (8h+)
 * If time remains start think about the accelerometers

The other block of time (20h) was mainly for working with the accel. I'm thinking something like this.

 * Provide some examples of advanced accelerometer use for future reference
 * Consider some amendments to the Xbee protocol to work better with accel
 * Prototype the often discussed speed limited version of the basic propinquity game
 * Play test this prototype in the TAG lab
